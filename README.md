I made this readme file and this repository to submit the first homework. 

> The first part (Introduce myself) was designed at GitHub to be familiar with Markdown.
> The seconde part (My research interest) was pushed from R-studio. Please check my first homework and enjoy!


## 1. Introduce my self

Hi. I am **Yeonuk Kim** from South Korea.

I graduated from Seoul National University in South Korea and I am an incoming MSc student for [RES program.](http://ires.ubc.ca/) :thumbsup: I am also a member of [Ecohydro lab](http://ecohydro.ires.ubc.ca/). Nice to meet you guys.

Please see my contact info bellow.

## 2. My research interest (This section from local)

My previous research was related to data analysis. 

I analyzed various time series of micrometeorogical data like CO2 flux, evapotranspiration. I worked with MATLAB at that time, but I plan to use R in the future. I am not good at R now, but I am sure this course will help me to use this tool well. The picture is an example what I worked for. Also, you can see my journal paper at [this link.](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=iPxIapwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=iPxIapwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC)

- I will also analyze **remote sensing** data by using R for my graduate work. 
+ Therefore, proficiency in R is really important for me!
